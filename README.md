 # Data Structures and Algorithms
 
 Class projects made during my Data Structures and Algorithms class! 
 
 Overall, this was my favorite class. It was very challenging, but I met my favorite professor this semester.
 
 *Each project has a PDF file of instructions from my professor inside it's folder.*
 
 Some topics covered: 
 
 - CS1 Review (Basic code such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, functions, etc)
 - CS2 Review (Pointers, Classes, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Exceptions, Recursion, Templates, etc)
 - Data Structures, their applications, and using them in a real life scenario
   - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, Graphs
 - Algorithms for Searching and Sorting, their application, and what scenario they would be good for
   - Linear and binary search
   - Bubble, insertion, quick, and heap sort
 - Big O notation
 - Hashing
